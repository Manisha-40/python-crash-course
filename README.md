# Python crash course

This course is for people who already have experience in programming and want to learn Python quickly without wasting much time in finding the right course.

This course is created out of frustration of not finding any course online or any other resource to learn Python for programmers from other language background. 

In this course, I will be covering all the basics of Python (in-depth lessons will be added later on) so that you can get started in the language very quickly.
